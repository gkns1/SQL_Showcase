# SQL_Showcase_Complexity

A showcase of the kind of complexity of SQL code I worked with.

This is just one part of 1 configuration among 30 total in a project. This code extracts specific training items from a legacy LMS system that was decommissioned later.
The system I worked with had heavy limitations on the functions and syntax I could use. Hence repetitions in the code and some complex workarounds.
Any identifying elements have been redacted.
